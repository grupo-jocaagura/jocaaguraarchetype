/// Contract for building application themes from a [ThemeState].

/// Implementations should be **pure** and **idempotent**: for the same
/// `[state]` and `platformBrightness`, `ThemeData` output must be identical.
///
/// Guidance
/// - `toThemeData` should delegate to [lightTheme] or [darkTheme] based on
///   `platformBrightness` and/or rules encoded in `state` (e.g. explicit mode).
/// - [schemeFromSeed] must derive a [ColorScheme] from a seed [Color] and a
///   concrete [Brightness].
/// - [colorRandom] exists for **demos/tests**. Production implementations
///   should avoid randomness in critical code paths to keep reproducibility.
///
/// Business validation should happen **before** calling this service; normal
/// usage should not throw.
///
/// Implementers are responsible for honoring `state.overrides` and
/// `state.textOverrides` when composing the final `ThemeData`.
